**Findings:**
1. California experienced the second-highest number of crash events in the United States, with a total of 62,427 crashes, out of which 1,973 were fatal and 60,454 were non-fatal.
California had 3.16% fatalities while the US national average was 2.6% fatalities.

2. Terrain: North-Western California terrain is mountainous hence it is challenging to drive in this region.

3. Reduce Velocity: Lower Truck velocity in challenging conditions would improve the control and may lead to lesser events.

4. Training: Design a driver education program considering the challenges drivers face in these cities, incentivize good drivers.

5. The driver with ID A13 is recognized as the one who drives at the fastest speed based on the company's average velocity calculation.

6. Crane, Volvo and Ford trucks were among the most economical of the fleet!

7. An analysis of the inspections conducted by the federal and state government across 14 states for trucks indicated that a minimum of 39% of the inspections had violations and 13% of these inspections were found to be OOS (Out of Service) violations. An OOS (Out-of-Service) violation is a serious violation that is identified during a roadside inspection and requires a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) or driver to be immediately removed from service until the violation is corrected.
